    This is a quasi-realistic exercise with Fillerama in Django for jonhwilliams.com. You might notice the content seems disconnected, but edgy, irreverent, with a subtle undercurrent of poignancy. One of these weekends we might decide to put real content in there, but then we'ld have to charge you a subscription, implement modals, and assure you we respect your privacy and would *never* accidentally sell your address.

### Project Overview:
* Gunicorn is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX, perfect for serving Django projects in production
* Postgres
* WhiteNoise to serve static files
* Authenticate with 2FA
* GitHub Actions deploys main to dev automatically

### Tech stack:
* [requirements](https://github.com/kjon-life/kjon_django/blob/main/requirements.txt)
  * django-environ - separate local,dev,prod (in practice had to use environment variables to avoid commiting things to github which should not be there)
* Postgres
* Docker - to package Django apps as image (this is a fly.io thing)
* flyctl - to build images, config toml, and deploy
* GitHub Actions - for CI/CD (just because you can)
* Fly.io - for the serverless hosting platform (turns off for the 99.99999 percent of the time that no one is visiting the site)

```flyctl``` is a CLI tool from [Fly.io](http://fly.io)
You can read about it [here](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/).
